# Fake/Real Logo Detection using Deep learning

The purpose of the project is to develop a system that can automatically analyze visual characteristics and patterns in logo images, enabling the classification of logos as either genuine or fake. The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect fake/real logos. One such CNN architecture is VGG19, which has pre-trained layers and a great understanding of what defines an image in terms of shape, color, and structure. 

The CNN architecture contains a combination of layers that transform an image into output the model can understand. The process of fake/real logo detection involves forward and backward propagation iterating through all of the training samples in the network until the optimal weights are determined and only the most powerful and predictive neurons are activated to make a prediction. 

To deploy the model, Flask, a Python web framework, can be used. Flask provides a simple way to deploy machine learning models as web applications. The model can be loaded into the Flask application and the user can upload an image to the web application. The image is then passed through the model and the result is displayed on the web page. Flask also provides a way to host the web application on a server so that it can be accessed from anywhere.
